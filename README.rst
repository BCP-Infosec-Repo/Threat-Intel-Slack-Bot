Threat Intelligence Slack Bot
************************************

As organizations mature and scale their security infrastructure, it's vital that analysts, engineers, and other team members are able to query and enrich data on demand. Additionally, application features are being introduced at an increasing rate, creating the need for software defined infrastructure. In this project, we'll be exploring scaling automation efforts - with a focus on Threat Intelligence. This project can serve as a guide for when to leverage an interactive bot, creating API endpoints, serverless architecture, and applying actionable threat intelligence.
